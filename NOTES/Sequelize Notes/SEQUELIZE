Sequelize is a promise-based node.js ORM for postgres. 
An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper (maps relationships)

1. Install Sequelize: 

    npm install - -save Sequelize

2. Create a database:

    createdb databaseName

3. Postgres and Postico to check if the database is there

**funfact**: 
    most of the methods provided by Sequelize are asynchronous, 
    therefore are promises.

How to create a Model: (a model is a table in the databases)
const db = 
const Model= db.define("model", {
    name: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING,
        allowNull: false,
    }
}) 

Class Methods:
Model.classMethods

Instance Method: 
Model.prototype.instanceMethods

Eager-loading:

this. findAll({
    where: {
        userType: "TEACHER",
    },
    include: {
        model: User,
        as: "mentee" 
    }
})

module.exports = Model
